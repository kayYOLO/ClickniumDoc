## Can not automate browser running instances with different user profiles

If you encountered the subsequent issue when recording:

![multiple user profile error](img/faq_multiple_profile_error.png)

This is due to the possibility that you have started several Chrome browser windows using different user profiles. Every Chrome browser window's user profile is visible in the top-right corner.

![multiple user profile](img/faq_mulitple_profile2.png)

You can fix this issue by first stopping Clicknium Recorder, closing all open browser tabs, opening the browser solely in a single user profile, and then starting a new recording.

## This element is not similar to previous elements. Please capture it again

If you encountered the subsequent issue when recording similar elements, 

![similar element error](img/faq_similar_elelemt_error.png)

The new recorded locator being different from the old one should be the primary factor. For example:

- They are elements of various types, for example: one with tag "a" and the other with tag "div".
- They are under different iframes.

For more information, please refer to [Capture similar elements](tutorial/recorder/capture_similar_elements.md)
